# Matt Dawson 

A Challenge oriented and strong growth mindset individual, I am always looking for new learning opportunities, as I am most engaged when I am lost. 
I spent the last few years working in a PropTech startup, primarily as a photographer (despite no prior experience), helping to create the ability to digitally capture 3d propety tours as well as consistently accurate volumetric data. 
As the technology began to work consistently and no new features were planned, I felt my role had run its course, but left with a newfound inspiration to create new Tech and solutions. To this end I began a Full Stack Deverloper course at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

I'm keen to join the tech indsutry as a developer, both due to interest from my previous role in a Tech start-up, but also to be a part of the digitization of the future, to which I firmly believe we have barely dipped a toe in an ocean. 
I am most inspired by technology such as Palantir Foundry, Tesla self driving, Square, Upstart, Zillow, Twilio, SalesForce and AWS, and am very keen to find a role in building the future world.

### <a name="experience">Experience</a>

**Makers Academy** (March 2021 to June 2020)
Studying to be a Full Stack Software Engineer, project and pair programming focus, specializing in Ruby and Javascript but with intention to learn Python.

**Pupil** (July 2017 to October 2020)    
*Digital Surveyor*

Joined in the very early days and helped field test the tech and software, interfacing with engineering and testing teams to drive further development
Helped take the technology from an early prototype to a fully functioning business software
Due to my consistently high performance I was selected for a solo project to improve both the speed and quality of our data capture process, I achieved this by: 
  - Using Data analytics and research to establish a baseline time and error rate to compare to our target, as well as establish performance metrics for operations team
  - Use targeted interviews with other high performers to build a library of successful habits and methodologies, as well as the inverse for lower performers 
  - Test new combinations of the successful methodologies until I created the optimal method for both errors and speed 
  - Disseminated the new method to the operations team. Both the speed and quality of data capture noticable improved as well as training simplicity
  
**Nineteen Events** (March 20017 to July 2017)   
*Sales Executive*  

Selling exhibition space for UK Security Expo (now International Security Expo), my role was mainly to research, determine eligibility and ultimately selling floorspace to 
security companies. My main niche within the team was new tech developments, including Drones, CyberSecurity and technology driven security solutions.

**Deloitte** (June 2014 to August 2014)   
*Tax Associate*  

A largely self directed and and independent internship, I was placed within the Diageo team with the freedom to attach myself to various projects, based in the Deloitte UK head office.
In my time at Deloitte I was involved in a large scale price unification project, learned how to calculate and minimise tax liabilities for individuals and for corporations and proof-read and edited reports for my colleagues.
I also used my free time to arrange meetings with professionals from the many other income streams in Deloitte, including Digital consulting, corporate finance, management consulting and audit.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Fast Learner** - Begining with my History degree where every week we had to research and analyse question in our own time, to learning professional level photography on the job, to teaching myself Ruby, RSpec and basic rails for my coding bootcamp. I am most in my element when I am learning.
- **High Growth Mindset** - I have total comfort and confidence engaging in new skills/ knoweldge, happy to struggle in ignorance till I reach new levels of understanding. Contrary to how most people operate, I specifically seek jobs with challenge because I find myself disengaged when work is too simple. 
- **Attention to detail** - After years as a professional photographer specializing in property photography, to now pouring over pages of code looking for errors, and honed through years of reading and research for university/ news, spotting details and inconsistencies is a firm talent of mine. 
- **Adaptablility** - I started with a History degree, I took a 6 month gap year in SE Asia moving to new cities/ countries every few days, I moved from sales to photography to software development. Each of these transitions felt as easy and natural to me as changing a set of clothes, and am content in the knowledge I will have to do it many more times in my career as a developer.
